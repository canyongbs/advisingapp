    - title: Querying the same field for different union types
      description: |
        When querying a field that returns a union type, you may get back an error "conflict because they return conflicting types". For example, if you query for interactable on a union type of `Student | Prospect` and request `full_name` you may get back this error.
        
        This is due to the fields having different type definitions. In order to get around this you will need to define an alias for the field you are querying.
        
        For example, you can query for `student_full_name: full_name` and `prospect_full_name: full_name` to get back the data you are looking for.
