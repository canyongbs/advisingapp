# Local Setup

### Requirements
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) version `26.0.0` or higher
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version `2.25.0` or higher (It is most likely that the way you installed Docker already came with Docker Compose, so on most systems you probably need not install this)
* [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Optional, but recommended)
* Spin CLI
  * [Spin MacOS](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/docs/installation/install-macos#install-docker-desktop)
  * [Spin Linux](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/docs/installation/install-linux)

### Pre-Setup

#### NVM

NVM is used in this project to ensure that the correct version of Node is being used. This is not a requirement, but it is highly recommended. If you do not wish to use NVM, you can simply install the correct version of Node on your host machine and skip the NVM setup.

To install NVM, follow the instructions on the [NVM GitHub page | Installing and Updating](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

After installing NVM, you can install the correct version of Node by running the following command in the root of the project:

```bash
nvm install
```

This will install the version of Node specified in the `.nvmrc` file. You can then use this version of Node by running the following command:

```bash
nvm use
```

Details on how to automatically use the correct version of Node when entering the project directory can be found on the [NVM GitHub page | Deeper Shell Integration](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration)

#### Local hosts file

In order to access the application in a web browser either in local or remote development you will need to place the following in your local `/etc/hosts` (or equivalent) file:

```bash
127.0.0.1 advisingapp.local
127.0.0.1 mail.tools.advisingapp.local
127.0.0.1 redis.tools.advisingapp.local
127.0.0.1 test.advisingapp.local
```

> Note: If you want any other tenant domains other than `test.advisingapp.local` you will need to add them to your `etc/hosts` file in the same way as well.

### Setup

#### 1. Set up the `.env` file
First, create an `.env` file based on `.env.example`
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

---

#### 2. Install Composer Dependencies

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v "$(pwd):/var/www/html" \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php82-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs --no-scripts
```

---

#### 3. Start the containers and open a shell into the main PHP container

Run the following command to start the containers:

```bash
spin up -d
```

Once the containers are started you can now start a shell into the main PHP container by running the following command:

```bash
spin exec -it -u webuser advisingapp.local bash
```

All following commands will and should be run from within the PHP container.

---

#### 4. Set up the application

We will set up the application by running the following commands:
```bash
php artisan migrate:landlord:fresh
php artisan key:generate
php artisan queue:restart
php artisan schedule:interrupt
npm ci
php artisan filament:upgrade
```

The above commands will set up the application for the "landlord" database. The landlord database is in charge of holding all information on tenants. Next we will set up a tenant.

```bash
php artisan tenants:create [A Name for the Tenant] [A domain for the tenant]
```

These commands will create a new tenant with the name and domain you supplied and then refresh and seed the tenant's database.

After this the application should be accessible at the domain you supplied.

Spin can be stopped by running `spin stop` and turned back on by running `spin up -d`

Setup is now complete.

---

### Customizing container settings and Ports

Within the `.env.example` (and within the `.env` after you copy it) should exist the following variables:

```dotenv
FORWARD_DB_PORT=3306
FORWARD_DB_PORT_TEST=3309
FORWARD_REDIS_PORT=6379
FORWARD_MEILISEARCH_PORT=7700
FORWARD_MAILPIT_PORT=1025
FORWARD_MAILPIT_DASHBOARD_PORT=8025
```

Those variables will allow you to edit particular settings and forwarding ports for your local containers. A great example of this usage is within the database section below.

### Accessing the Database
Within the containers, MySQL lives on port 3306. And by default it can be accessed outside of the containers on port 3308 as well.

If port 3306 is already in use on your system or you prefer to use another port,
you can set the `FORWARD_DB_PORT` in your `.env` file to whatever available
port you want.

### Storage
This application makes use of S3 for storage. If you would like to use local storage. In order to do so, create a new public s3 bucket with the following policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME]/PUBLIC/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

After creating the bucket, you can set the following variables in your `.env` file:

```dotenv
AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_S3_DEFAULT_REGION=
AWS_S3_BUCKET=
AWS_S3_ROOT=
```

### Queue and Scheduler

The application should automatically start a queue worker and scheduler when you run `spin up -d`. If you preferred to not have these running. You can see the corresponding `env` variables to false like so:

```dotenv
LARAVEL_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false
LARAVEL_QUEUE_ENABLED=false
```
