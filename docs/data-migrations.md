# Data Migrations

Data migrations in the application are created, stored, and executed much in the same way as Laravel schema migrations.

## Introduction

Data migrations are used to perform one-time operations on the database. This can be used to migrate data from one format to another, or to perform data cleanup operations.

Data migrations are contained in typical Laravel migration files. But contain a particular prefix to differentiate them from schema migrations. And are subject to a specific set of rules.

## Usage

### Creating Data Migrations

A data migration can be created using the `make:migration` Artisan command as is typical with Laravel migrations. Please prepend the name of the migration with `data_` to differentiate it from schema migrations.

Migrations created in the `database/migrations` directory are automatically run on all Tenants. Whereas the migrations created in the `database/landlord` directory are run only on the Landlord database.

For example:

```bash
php artisan make:migration data_change_name_in_users_table
```

When creating data migrations it is important to adhere to the following rules:

1. Do **NOT** use references to classes and facades that could be removed in the future. This includes Eloquent models. Currently, the only accepted classes to use within migrations are as follows:
    - `Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB`
        - Used to Interact with the database.
    - `Laravel\Pennant\Feature`
        - To interact with feature flagging.
2. As mentioned above, ensure all possible SQL errors are captured and handled, such as `UniqueConstraintExeception`. Also ensure that any database change is surrounded by a transaction to prevent corruption of the query connection.
2. Ensure that the migration is idempotent. This means that the migration can be run multiple times without causing any issues. Tables and columns should be checked for the existence, SQL errors should be caught and properly handled, and data should be checked if it is in the expected state before it is changed, etc.
3. You **MUST** include a `down` method in the migration.
    - In production, Data migrations are intended to be run once and not rolled back. If you need to fix a data migration that has been run in Production already, you should create a new data migration to do so.
    - The reason we add a `down` to our data migrations is to facilitate testing of these data migrations in special cases.
4. Do **NOT** include schema changes in data migrations. Schema changes should be done in schema migrations. Data migrations should only be used to manipulate data.
5. If you are adding permissions to the application, that technically is a data migration. But we consider it a special type. Details on how to do so can be found in the [Roles and Permisisons](/docs/roles-and-permissions.md) documentation.

### Running Data Migrations

Because data migrations are stored in the same directory as schema migrations, they can be run using the `migrate` Artisan command.

To run migrations from the Landlord database:

```bash
php artisan migrate --database=landlord --path=database/landlord
```

To run migrations on all Tenants:

```bash
php artisan migrate --database=tenant
```
