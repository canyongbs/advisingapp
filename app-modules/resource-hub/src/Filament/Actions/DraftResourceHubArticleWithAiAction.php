                            You should only respond with the article content, you should never greet them.
                            The first line should contain the raw title of the article, with no "Title: " label at the start.
                            All following lines after the title are the article body.

                            When you answer, it is crucial that you format the article body using rich text in Markdown format.
                            The title line can not use Markdown formatting, it is plain text.

                            Then, write the article content on the following instructions provided by user.
