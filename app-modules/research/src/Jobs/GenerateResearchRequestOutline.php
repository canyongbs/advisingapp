            Use the file content of the attached vector store as an input to your analysis.
            
            Before the research is conducted, you need to help improve the chances that it will be relevant and useful to me. Based on this research prompt, and all the context provided, create an outline for this "research report" that has an abstract, introduction, body, and conclusion.

            Ensure you follow the following additional rules:
            - The abstract, introduction, and conclusion should each have a unique heading that represents the content of that section.
            - Aside from the abstract, introduction, and conclusion, there should be 6 content sections in the middle of the report, each with 3 subsections inside.
            - All the content should be written as a scholar would at the PhD level.
